Imports the neural networks module from PyTorch, commonly aliased as `nn`.
---
Line 3: `import torch.optim as optim`

---
Line 6-8: `# Assuming data loader and model classes will be imported`
`# from data.btc_preprocessor import BTCDataLoader`
`# from models.btc_transformer import BTCTransformer`
These are commented-out lines indicating that data loader and model classes from other files will be imported here in the future.
---
Line 10: `class Trainer:`
Defines a Python class named `Trainer`.
---
Line 11-26: `    def __init__(`
`        self, `
`        model: nn.Module, `
`        train_loader, # Placeholder for DataLoader`
`        val_loader,   # Placeholder for DataLoader`
`        optimizer: optim.Optimizer,`
`        criterion: nn.Module, # Loss function`
`        device: torch.device,`
`        epochs: int,`
`        gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 1,`
`        use_amp: bool = True # Use Automatic Mixed Precision`
`    ):`
This is the constructor method (`__init__`) for the `Trainer` class. It takes various parameters necessary for training:
- `model`: The neural network model to be trained.
- `train_loader`: An object (like a PyTorch DataLoader) that provides training data in batches.
- `val_loader`: An object that provides validation data in batches.
- `optimizer`: The optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD) used to update model weights.
- `criterion`: The loss function used to measure the difference between model outputs and targets.
- `device`: The device (CPU or GPU) where the model and data will be processed.
- `epochs`: The total number of training epochs.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: An integer specifying how many batches to process before performing an optimizer step (for accumulating gradients).
- `use_amp`: A boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Mixed Precision.

Line 27-35: `        self.model = model`
`        self.train_loader = train_loader`
`        self.val_loader = val_loader`
`        self.optimizer = optimizer`
`        self.criterion = criterion`
`        self.device = device`
`        self.epochs = epochs`
`        self.gradient_accumulation_steps = gradient_accumulation_steps`
`        self.use_amp = use_amp`
`        
        # Initialize GradScaler for AMP`
`        self.scaler = GradScaler('cuda') if use_amp else None`
These lines assign the input parameters to instance variables (`self.attribute_name`), making them accessible throughout the class. It also initializes `self.scaler`, an instance of `GradScaler` used for scaling gradients in AMP training, only if `use_amp` is True and specifies 'cuda' as the device.
---
Line 37: `    def train_one_epoch(self, epoch: int):`
Defines a method named `train_one_epoch` that handles the training process for a single epoch. It takes the current epoch number as input.
---
Line 38: `        self.model.train()`
Sets the model to training mode. This enables features like dropout and batch normalization that behave differently during training and evaluation.
---
Line 39: `        running_loss = 0.0`
Initializes a variable `running_loss` to 0.0 to accumulate the loss over the epoch.
---
Line 41: `        # Reset gradients every accumulation steps`
This is a comment explaining the purpose of the next line.
---
Line 42: `        self.optimizer.zero_grad()`
Resets the gradients of the model's parameters. This is done at the beginning of each effective batch (after gradient accumulation).
---
Line 44: `        for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(self.train_loader):`
Starts a loop to iterate over batches provided by the `train_loader`. `i` is the batch index, `inputs` are the input features, and `targets` are the target values.
---
Line 45: `            inputs, targets = inputs.to(self.device), targets.to(self.device)`
Moves the input features and target values to the specified device (CPU or GPU).
---
Line 47: `            # Use autocast for mixed precision if enabled`
This is a comment explaining the purpose of the next line.
---
Line 48: `            with autocast('cuda', enabled=self.use_amp):`
Enters an `autocast` context manager. When `enabled=True` (i.e., `use_amp` is True), operations within this block will use mixed precision (usually float16 for operations that support it and float32 otherwise) on the 'cuda' device to potentially speed up training and reduce memory usage.
---
Line 49: `                outputs = self.model(inputs)`
Performs the forward pass: the input features (`inputs`) are passed through the model to get predictions (`outputs`).
---
Line 50: `                loss = self.criterion(outputs, targets)`
Calculates the loss between the model's outputs and the true targets using the specified criterion (loss function).
---
Line 51: `                loss = loss / self.gradient_accumulation_steps # Scale loss for accumulation`
Scales the loss by the number of gradient accumulation steps. This is necessary because the gradients for this batch will be accumulated over multiple steps before an optimizer update.
---
Line 53: `            # Backward pass and optimization step with scaler for AMP`
This is a comment explaining the purpose of the next lines.
---
Line 54: `            if self.use_amp:`
Checks if AMP is enabled.
---
Line 55: `                self.scaler.scale(loss).backward()`
If AMP is enabled, it scales the loss using `self.scaler` before calling `backward()`. This helps prevent numerical underflow with small gradients in float16.

Line 56: `            else:`
If AMP is not enabled.
---
Line 57: `                loss.backward()`

---
Line 59: `            # Perform optimization step and scaler update every accumulation steps`

Line 61: `                if self.use_amp:`
If AMP is enabled.
---
Line 62: `                    self.scaler.step(self.optimizer)`
If using AMP, this call unscales the gradients and calls `optimizer.step()` to update model parameters. The `scaler` handles skipping the update if gradients are found to be NaN or Inf.
---
Line 63: `                    self.scaler.update()`
Updates the scale factor used by `GradScaler` for the next iteration.
---
Line 64: `                else:`
If AMP is not enabled.
---
Line 65: `                    self.optimizer.step()`
Performs a standard optimizer step to update model parameters based on the accumulated gradients.
---
Line 66: `                self.optimizer.zero_grad()`
Resets the gradients after an optimizer step.
---
Line 68: `            running_loss += loss.item() * self.gradient_accumulation_steps # Unscale loss for reporting`
Adds the loss for the current batch to `running_loss`. The loss is unscaled back to its original value for accurate reporting.
---
Line 70: `        # Handle remaining gradients if dataset size is not a multiple of accumulation steps`
This is a comment explaining the purpose of the next lines.
---
Line 71: `        if len(self.train_loader) % self.gradient_accumulation_steps != 0:`
Checks if there are any remaining gradients from batches that didn't form a full `gradient_accumulation_steps` group at the end of the epoch.
---
Line 72-77: `             if self.use_amp:`
`                self.scaler.step(self.optimizer)`
`                self.scaler.update()`
`             else:`
`                self.optimizer.step()`
`             self.optimizer.zero_grad()`
If there are remaining gradients, an additional optimization step and gradient reset are performed to use these gradients.
---

Prints the average training loss for the current epoch.
---
Line 81: `    def validate_one_epoch(self, epoch: int):`
Defines a method named `validate_one_epoch` that handles the validation process for a single epoch. It takes the current epoch number as input.
---
Line 82: `        self.model.eval()`
Sets the model to evaluation mode. This disables features like dropout and ensures batch normalization uses running statistics.
---
Line 83: `        running_loss = 0.0`
Initializes a variable `running_loss` to 0.0 to accumulate the loss over the validation epoch.
---
Line 84: `        with torch.no_grad():`

---
Line 85: `            for inputs, targets in self.val_loader:`
Starts a loop to iterate over batches provided by the `val_loader`.
---
Line 86: `                inputs, targets = inputs.to(self.device), targets.to(self.device)`
Moves the input features and target values to the specified device.

---
Line 97: `    def train(self):`
Defines the main `train` method that orchestrates the entire training process over multiple epochs.
---
Line 98: `        best_val_loss = float('inf')`
